### :scream: Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.

Statement of the problem
Numbers from 1 to 9999 and their corresponding total stopping time
Histogram of total stopping times for the numbers 1 to 108. Total stopping time is on the x axis, frequency on the y axis.
Histogram of total stopping times for the numbers 1 to 109. Total stopping time is on the x axis, frequency on the y axis.
Iteration time for inputs of 2 to 107.
Total Stopping Time: numbers up to 250, 1000, 4000, 20000, 100000, 500000
Total stopping time of numbers up to 250, 1000, 4000, 20000, 100000, 500000

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

    If the number is even, divide it by two.
    If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

In modular arithmetic notation, define the function f as follows:
